# Coal power plants

## Power plants considered

We consider the following coal power plants in the Jakarta area:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plants <- data.get_plants()
plants
```

## Dispersion modeling

We use HYSPLIT to model dispersion from each coal power plant, with the following parameters and assumptions :
- constant emission rate;
- each particle is followed for five days;
- released at height based on stack height and estimated plume rise.

Below are dispersion modeling results for Suralaya power plant on 3 January 2023.
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
knitr::include_graphics("results/suralaya_20230103.png")
```
    
    

## Attribution

We then compute the density of particles emitted by each power plant at each receptor location on any given day. We only consider particles below 10 meters.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("results/contributions_bar.png")
```

### Limitations

The dispersion modeling does not consider chemical reactions, and therefore does not account for the transformation of pollutants into secondary pollutants.
