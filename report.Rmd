# Coal power plants

## Power plants considered

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
plants <- get_plants(as_sf=F)
knitr::kable(plants)
```

## Dispersion modeling

We use HYSPLIT to model dispersion from each coal power plant, with the following parameters :
- constant emission rate
- each particle followed for four days
- released at height based on stack height and plume rise

Below is dispersion modeling example for Soralaya power plant on 1 January 2023.
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
knitr::include_graphics("results/soralaya_20230201.png")
```
    
    

## Attribution

We then compute density of particles emitted by each power plant at each receptor location. The numbers obtained are transformed into a meaningful unit: µg/m3 for each µg emitted within a day by the power plant. For instance, if a power plants emits 10 tonnes of PM2.5 in a day, and the indicated contribution number is 1e-15, the resulting concentration at the receptor location is 0.01 µg/m3 (1e13 * 1e-15).

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("results/contribution.png")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
