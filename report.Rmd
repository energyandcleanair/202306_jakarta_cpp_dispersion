# Coal power plants

## Power plants considered

We consider the following coal power plants in the Jakarta area:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plants <- data.get_plants()
plants
```

## Dispersion modeling

We use HYSPLIT to model dispersion from each coal power plant, with the following parameters and assumptions :
- constant emission rate;
- each particle is followed for five days;
- released at height based on stack height and estimated plume rise.

Below are dispersion modeling results for Suralaya power plant on 3 January 2023.
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
knitr::include_graphics("results/suralaya_20230103.png")
```
    
    

## Attribution

### Density computation
We then compute the density of particles emitted by each power plant at each receptor location on any given **reception** hour, including 5 full days of emissions. 

- we use UTM coordinates
- we filter for particles below 10 meters
- we compute density using MASS::kde2d function

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("results/contributions_bar.png"))
```

### Scaling to a meaningful unit

By default, the density is computed so that the integral of the density over the whole area is equal to one. Given that we use UTM coordinates, this means the density is expressed in m-2.

To bring it to a useful unit, we perform several operations:

- we scale down the density to account for particles that were above 10 meters;
- we divide by the threshold height itself (i.e. 10m) to obtained the density in m-3.

In any given cell, the obtained raster therefore indicates the concentration of 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("results/contributions_bar_region.png")
```

### Limitations

The dispersion modeling does not consider chemical reactions, and therefore does not account for the transformation of pollutants into secondary pollutants.
